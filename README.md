# The PIG Game

https://pig-game-usman.netlify.app/

A fun 2 player risk-reward game. First player to bank 50 points wins!

**Rules:**

- Players alternate each other over multiple rounds of dice rolls.
- Each player can roll the dice multiple times in each round to add to their score for that round. Press 'Hold' to bank the earned points and pass the turn to the opponent.
- If a player rolls 1, however, they will lose all points earned in that round and lose the turn.

_How much will you risk by not banking those precious points?_
